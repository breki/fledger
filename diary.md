# fledger Development Diary

Migrated to .NET 8.

## 2024-01-02

Got back to the project after a very long time. I've added this diary to keep
everything in a single place instead of Notion.

I've also added the `Run-Build.ps1` build script and written the basic build 
instructions in `README.md`.

The next step would be to migrate the project to .NET 8 and then go back to 
work on the parsing and processing of the hledger journal files.
